# Risk and Return: Finding an Investment Portfolio in the Efficient Frontier
This notebook aims to explore the problem of constructing an investment portfolio from a set of tickers, seeking an optimal balance between risk and returns. The goal is to identify portfolios on the Efficient Frontier, a corollary of Markowitz's Mean-Variance Theory (1952). Unlike most notebooks Unlike most pedagogical notebooks found on the internet or on github, in this case, although the code uses example cases, it is designed for a comprehensive and customizable analysis based on the available data or any additional data that one wishes to include.
